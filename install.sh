# X Linux on WSL - guided installer (single friendly entry point).
#
# Runs the two-part setup for a freshly imported X Linux distribution. It
# detects the context and forwards to the matching stage; setup.sh remains the
# lower-level dispatcher and accepts the same options.
#
#   Part 1 (system): root on a fresh import  -> stage-root.sh
#         locale, keymap, timezone, base tools and the sudo user
#   Part 2 (user):   the created user        -> stage-user.sh
#         shell prompt, environment variables and folders
#
# Typical flow:
#   1. wsl -d <distro>                         (opens as root)
#   2. ./install.sh                            (Part 1, system)
#   3. exit, then wsl -d <distro> again        (now opens as your user)
#   4. ./install.sh                            (Part 2, user)

Guided setup for X Linux on WSL.

Run it twice on the freshly imported distribution:
  as root            -> Part 1 (system): locale, keymap, timezone, base
                        tools and the sudo user.
  as your new user   -> Part 2 (user): shell, environment and folders.

System options are forwarded to the system stage:
  --locale LOCALE   Locale (default en_US.UTF-8).
  --keymap KEYMAP   Keyboard keymap (default us).
  --timezone ZONE   windows-time, UTC or an IANA zone.
  --user NAME       User to create or ensure with sudo.
  --shell SHELL     Login shell: zsh or bash.
  --sudo POLICY     Sudo policy: nopasswd or password.
  --no-install      Skip installing base tools with pacman.

Environment:
  X_AUTO=1          Use defaults without prompting.
  X_DRY=1           Print the plan without applying changes.
  -h, --help        Show this help.

X Linux on WSL - guided setup

This installer runs in two parts:
  Part 1 (system):  as root, right after importing the distribution.
                    Configures locale, keymap, timezone, base tools and
                    creates your user with sudo.
  Part 2 (user):    as that user, after relaunching the distribution.
                    Configures your shell prompt, environment and folders.
